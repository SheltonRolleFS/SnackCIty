# Snack City

SnackCity is a snack company located in The Bahamas. Although a small company, this websites goal is to provide users with a wide range of features to make snack shopping easy and effecient. So far, we are using the ReactJS framework since there will be a lot of recurring components such as headers, snack item cards and user profiles. We also chose to use SASS to make use of its wide variety of features for a more organized styling collection.
